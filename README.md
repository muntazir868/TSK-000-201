## Spam Email Detection
 Use machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
 Preprocess email data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and applying
techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word
embeddings.
 Train a classification model, such as Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector
Machine), or a deep learning model like a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a
transformer-based model.
 Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-
score.
